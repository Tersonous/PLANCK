# planckVRV32I
Core based on RV32I ISA... not really. VRISK-V ISA, a MORE REDUCED ISA based on RISC-V.

As my first serious verilog project, i use tips from https://github.com/ataradov/riscv , thanks to him !

Also thanks for : https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal

#VRISC-V ISA

Very Reduced Instruction Computer-V ISA

Same registers = x0 to x31
No pseudoinstructions with some exceptions
No branching instructions (execute instruction one after another)
No change in the Stack

First Core Implementation in Planck

Do some researchs on the Planck lenght to see why i want to do that.
